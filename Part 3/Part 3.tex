\section{Model Verification and Validation}

The goal of the validation is to produce a model that represents true system behavior closely enough for the model
to be used as a substitute for the actual system. 

\subsection{Verification of Simulation Models}

Verification is concerned with building the model correctly. It proceeds by the comparison of the conceptual model to the computer representation what implements that conception.

\subsubsection{Flow Diagram}
I made a flow diagram that includes each logically possible action a system can take when an event occurs.
